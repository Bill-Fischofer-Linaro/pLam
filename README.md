# Î»-calculus interpreter
(on its way to become fun programming language)

## Prerequisites
This project builds using Haskell tool stack documented at https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/.

## Install
On most Unix systems, you can get stack by typing:
```
curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
```
or:
```
wget -qO- https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
```
On Windows, you can download 64-bit installer given at https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/.

## Build & Run
1. clone project repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/sandrolovnicki/lambda-calculus-interpreter.git
```
2. go to project directory:
```
cd lambda-calculus-interpreter
```
3. setup stack on isolated location
```
stack setup
```
4. use stack to build project:
```
stack build
```
5. use stack to run project executable
```
stack exec lci
```
